    <h4>
      My Two Months as a Student Teacher: A Journey of Patience and Understanding
    </h4>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      In the early months of 2021, I had the privilege of collaborating with the Angel Xpress Foundation (AXF) to teach English and Mathematics to underprivileged children in Mumbai's public schools. This experience was much more than a teaching assignment; it was a profound journey into the heart of educational equity.

    <h3>
      The Challenge of Teaching Diverse Learners
    </h3>
    <p>
      As I stepped into this role, I was filled with a blend of excitement and nervous anticipation. The challenge was not just to teach academic subjects but to do so in a way that was engaging and adapted to the diverse needs of my students, many of whom were encountering structured learning for the first time.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      My initial days were marked by a steep learning curve. I quickly realized that my students did not all absorb information at the same pace. This was a stark contrast to the more uniform academic environments I was accustomed to. It forced me to rethink my approach and learn to be patient, to understand that intelligence is multifaceted and that every child learns differently.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>
      A Lesson in Humility and Patience
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of the most humbling aspects of this experience was realizing how much I had taken for granted in my own education. Teaching these incredibly bright young minds, eager to learn and grow, showed me the vast disparities in access to education. It also taught me that being smart isn’t just about knowing things; it’s about understanding how to share that knowledge in a way that is accessible to others.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      This realization deepened my respect for educators and underscored the importance of patience, empathy, and tailored teaching methods. I learned to slow down, to explain concepts more thoroughly, and to celebrate small victories when a student grasped a challenging concept.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      The smiles, the aha-moments, and the gradual confidence in their eyes were incredibly rewarding. I felt a profound sense of accomplishment not from my own understanding, but from seeing the growth in my students.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      As I reflect on those two months with AXF, I am grateful for the lessons I learned about myself and about the power of education. It was an experience that reshaped my perspective on teaching and learning and inspired me to continue advocating for educational equity.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      To anyone considering teaching, especially in underprivileged settings, remember that the impact goes both ways. You are there to teach, but unexpectedly, you will learn just as much about yourself and the world around you.
